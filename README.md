This project compares neural networks with 1, 2, and 3 hidden layers on a nonlinear binary classification dataset (make_moons) using TensorFlow Keras.

It evaluates the impact of model depth on training loss, validation accuracy, and test performance.

Tech Used: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib
